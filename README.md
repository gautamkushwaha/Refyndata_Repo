## Note for Developers

Strictly create a branch first and then only start working on something.
Todo so you can follow the steps below:

1. Create branch

- $ git branch new_branch

2. Check all branch

- $ git branch -v

3. Change master -> new_branch

- $ git checkout new_branch

Now you can work from here whatever change you want to make you can do it now. After that follow the below steps.

4. Track files specific to new_branch

- $ git add .

5. Now change back to Master branch from new_branch

- $ git checkout master

6. Commit & Push new_branch to server now

- $ git commit -m "your message"

- $ git push -u origin new_branch

7. Merge new_branch to master

- $ git merge new_branch

8. After merge we can push the changes to the server

- $ git push origin master

9. After doing all if you want to delete new_branch locally then do the following

- $ git branch -D new_branch

10. Now push the changes so that new_branch gets deleted on the server as well

- $ git push origin --delete new_branch

#guide for the maintainance
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More
